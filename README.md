# CDD Contest #1

This is the github repository of a contest managed by '[Caf√© des Devs](https://discord.com/cafedesdevs)', a french discord server which is a community of developers.

This contest is a design-implementation contest. You have to make the most optimized and easy-to-read website.
I personally wanted to push the challenge even further and have a clean development environment with a fully optimized final build.

Technologies used:
1. [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp)
2. [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass/blob/main/js-api-doc/compile.d.ts)
3. [Postcss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss)
4. [cssnano](https://github.com/cssnano/cssnano)

Check the README.md located under the "build/" directory to get more informations of how is organized the project.
